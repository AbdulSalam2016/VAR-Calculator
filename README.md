Value at Risk (VaR) Calculator

Purpose:
This tool calculates the Value at Risk (VaR) for a portfolio using both Monte Carlo simulations and Parametric methods. It provides some results and visualizations tailored to the user's inputs.

Instructions:
1. From the sidebar, choose your desired stocks. This selection will determine the composition of the portfolio for which VaR is calculated. Select at least two stocks.
2. Specify the historical period for adjusted close daily stock price data retrieval, which will be sourced directly from the Yahoo Finance live API.
3. Ensure the total sum of the portfolio weights for the selected stocks equals 1. Adjust the weights accordingly to meet this requirement.
